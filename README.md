# CS-449
Hello! This is written as of 9/21/23. This repository showcases an ongoing semester long project for the CS449 (Software Engineering) course I'm taking.
I am developing a board game called "SOS", which is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.
This is my first experience with Java as well as with unit testing and GUI creation. 
I am also learning how to develop software with Scrum. This involves planning for what tools I will use, setting goals, and what the definition of done is.
